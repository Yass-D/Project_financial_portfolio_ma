# Project_financial_portfolio_ma
Hello,

For my first Python project, I decided to analyze the Moroccan stock market by focusing on a selection of stocks, primarily in the real estate, banking, and healthcare sectors.
One challenge I encountered was retrieving the data and trading days. As a workaround, I had to register on the Casablanca Stock Exchange website and receive the stock values for each selected company via email in an Excel file.

The chosen stocks are:

- MUTANDIS
- ADDOHA
- MED_PAPER
- RISMA
- TGCC
- CDM
- IMMORENTE
- DAR_SAADA
- ARADEI_CAPITAL

Objectives of this analysis:

- Determine whether there is a correlation between the analyzed financial indicators.
- Identify if there is a correlation between the trends of these financial indicators.
- Calculate the risk-return pair (volatility and return) and present it in a graph.
- Calculate the Sharpe Ratio to rank the stocks based on the return of an investment in relation to its risk.
- Conduct a backtest for a Cross MA strategy.
